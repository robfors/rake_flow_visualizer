# Rake Flow Visualizer
This Ruby Gem will help you determine the order of task execution of an existing project using Rake. I wrote it to help reverse engineer a complex project I found and wanted to clean up.'

# Install
`gem install rake_flow_visualizer`

# Run
When you are in your project's root directory simply run `rake_flow_visualizer`.
